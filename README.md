# Rosethorn
Rosethorn is a small indie chatbot I have started creating in Java.

# NOTE: It may be changed over to Python in the future

I have no idea what this chatbot will become but when I am positive it is working, functional and has 0 bugs I will release it on here and itch.io as a fun companion to talk to.

Mobile: I may make this an app on mobile one day.

PC - Windows: It will be released on Windows first before anything else.

PC - Linux: Not sure how to use Linux or if a regular `.exe` would work but when released I will research it.

PC - Mac: I doubt I'll ever be able to figure out how to make this a .dmg but if I do I will release it on Mac.
